# Mahine-Learning
Hello everyone, I recently completed an exciting machine learning project using Python on a sales dataset. In this project, I utilized several powerful libraries, including pandas, numpy, os, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and scipy.

Here's a brief overview of the key libraries I used:

pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, providing efficient data structures and tools for handling the sales dataset.

numpy: Utilized for mathematical computations and array manipulation, enabling efficient and optimized operations on numerical data.

os: Employed for handling operating system functionalities, such as accessing and manipulating files and directories related to the sales dataset.

matplotlib: Utilized for data visualization, allowing me to create insightful plots and graphs to analyze and present the sales data visually.

seaborn: Utilized for advanced data visualization and statistical exploration, enhancing the visual presentation and analysis of the sales dataset.

scikit-learn: Utilized for machine learning tasks, specifically for implementing a Linear Regression model and performing train-test splitting to train and evaluate the model's performance.

scipy: Specifically, I used the ttest_1samp function from scipy.stats to perform a one-sample t-test, a statistical test to compare the mean of a sample to a known population mean.

sklearn.cluster: Utilized for performing K-means clustering, a popular unsupervised learning technique, which helps in grouping similar sales data points together.

sklearn.preprocessing: Utilized for data preprocessing tasks, such as standardization using the StandardScaler and label encoding using the LabelEncoder.

I'm thrilled with the results of this project, and I'm eager to share my findings and insights on LinkedIn. It was an exciting opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to analyze the sales dataset and gain valuable insights that can contribute to business decision-making.
